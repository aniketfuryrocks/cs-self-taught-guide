This github repo is a guide to become a self taught software enginner. I have listed all the essential topics that one needs to know, with their respected resources. All resources are free in public domain. Feel free to submit a pull request and help the community further.

1. ### Data Structures And Algorithms

The best place you can refer to is no other than [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org).

**Data Structures**

+ Array
+ Stack
+ Queue
+ Linked List
+ HashMap (Dictionaries in python, Map or Objects in JS)
+ HashSet
+ [Tree](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-useful-tree-data-structures-worth-knowing-8532c7231e8c)
+ + [Binary Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-1-introduction/?ref=lbp)
+ + [Binary Search Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/)
+ + [Heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-data-structure/)
+ Advance Tree
+ + [AVL tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/)
+ + [Red-Black Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/red-black-tree-set-1-introduction-2/)
+ + [Splay Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/splay-tree-set-1-insert/)
+ + [Trep](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/treap-a-randomized-binary-search-tree/)
+ + [B-tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-b-tree-2/)
+ [Graph Theory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mathematics-graph-theory-basics-set-1/?ref=lbp)
+ + [Video Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNEl4HE2OE)

For both Tree and Graph you need to know their traversal techniques.

[In-Order, Pre-Order, Post-Order for trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/)
