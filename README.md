# cs-self-taught-guide
This Github repo is a guide to becoming a self-taught software engineer. I have listed all the essential topics that one needs to know, with their respected resources. All resources are free in the public domain. Feel free to submit a pull request and help the community further.

This repo is still in early development, more topics will be added with time.

### Data Structures And Algorithms

The best place you can refer to is no other than [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org).

**Analysis of Algorithms(Asymptotic Analysis)**

You need to know how to analyze time and space complexity. It is not required to get into its math just yet. But you should have a jist of it, especially
Big O Notation. One should deeply understand this concept before approaching for an interview. You can read further on this topic [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-1-asymptotic-analysis/). I advise you to first do basic dsa and then read about Asymptotic Analysis.

**Data Structures**

+ Array
+ Stack
+ Queue
+ Linked List

For both Tree and Graph, you need to know their traversal techniques.

[In-Order, Pre-Order, Post-Order for trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/)
